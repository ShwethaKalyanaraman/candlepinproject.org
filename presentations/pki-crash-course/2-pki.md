# ASN.1

- Similar in concept to Backus-Naur Form
- A way to describe data and data-types
- Start simple and move up
- The building blocks of PKI

Note:
Pretty much everything is in ASN.1: Keys, certificates, certificate signing
requests, etc.

# ASN.1 - Trivial Example

```
Widget ::= SEQUENCE {
    model IA5String,
    serialNumber INTEGER,
    inspections InspectionInfo
}

InspectionInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
    inspectorName IA5String,
    inspectionDates SEQUENCE OF DATE
}
```

Note: Let's say we have a Widget.  Every Widget has a model name, a serial
number, and some inspection information with the name of the inspector and
the dates of the inspections.  Here's how we represent that in ASN.1.

Now let's go over that.  A SEQUENCE is one of the four ASN.1 structured types
and it's just an ordered collection of items.  Inside that sequence we have
an IA5String (International Alphabet 5 â€” basically ASCII), an INTEGER, and
then an item of InspectionInfo type.  We continue down and see InspectionInfo
is also a SEQUENCE containing the inspector's name and the inspection dates.
The inspection dates are a SEQUENCE OF, another structured type that holds
zero or more occurrences of a given type. In this case, the given type is
DATE.

# ASN.1 - Real Example

PKCS1 - Format for storing RSA keys

```none
RSAPublicKey ::= SEQUENCE {
    modulus           INTEGER,  -- n
    publicExponent    INTEGER   -- e
}

RSAPrivateKey ::= SEQUENCE {
    version           Version,
    modulus           INTEGER,  -- n
    publicExponent    INTEGER,  -- e
    privateExponent   INTEGER,  -- d
    prime1            INTEGER,  -- p
    prime2            INTEGER,  -- q
    exponent1         INTEGER,  -- d mod (p-1)
    exponent2         INTEGER,  -- d mod (q-1)
    coefficient       INTEGER,  -- (inverse of q) mod p
    otherPrimeInfos   OtherPrimeInfos OPTIONAL
}

Version ::= INTEGER { two-prime(0), multi(1) }
    (CONSTRAINED BY {
        -- version must be multi if otherPrimeInfos present --
    })

OtherPrimeInfos ::= SEQUENCE SIZE(1..MAX) OF OtherPrimeInfo

OtherPrimeInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
    prime             INTEGER,  -- ri
    exponent          INTEGER,  -- di
    coefficient       INTEGER   -- ti
}
```

# ASN.1 - According to OpenSSL's `asn1parse`

```none
% openssl genrsa 2048 2> /dev/null | openssl asn1parse
    0:d=0  hl=4 l=1189 cons: SEQUENCE
    4:d=1  hl=2 l=   1 prim: INTEGER           :00
    7:d=1  hl=4 l= 257 prim: INTEGER           :DF313FF1...
  268:d=1  hl=2 l=   3 prim: INTEGER           :010001
  273:d=1  hl=4 l= 257 prim: INTEGER           :A5CEE1B1...
  534:d=1  hl=3 l= 129 prim: INTEGER           :FEF2403F...
  666:d=1  hl=3 l= 129 prim: INTEGER           :E01D66B4...
  798:d=1  hl=3 l= 129 prim: INTEGER           :EFCF535C...
  930:d=1  hl=3 l= 129 prim: INTEGER           :A00CFF33...
 1062:d=1  hl=3 l= 128 prim: INTEGER           :38264063...
```

And we can see that corresponds to the schema described in the previous
slide for a private key.

# Formats

- DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules)
  - Binary encoding
  - No ambiguity; Only one way to represent any given value
- PEM
  - Base64 encoded DER with header and footer
  - Most common format
  - Example:
    ```none
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    MIIK6zCCBt+gAwIBAgIJAMXcvW[...]
    VQQGEwJVUzEXMBUGA1UECBMOTm[...]
    [...]
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    ```
- Anything can be in these formats: keys, certificates, signing requests
- Don't name your files ".pem".  It doesn't provide any information about
  what is actually in the file.

Note:
You've got all the components you need to define something in ASN.1.  Now
what?  We need to encode the data.  The standard method uses Distinguished
Encoding Rules which encode the data in an unambiguous manner.  DER is a
binary format which isn't very useful if you need to email the certificate
or print it to your terminal.  Taking the DER and base64 encoding it solves
the problem.  Now we have a blob of ASCII text that we add a descriptive
header and footer onto.  The result is a PEM file.  PEM stands for
Privacy-enhanced Electronic Mail which is due to the format's history
with PGP.  It's a fun bit of trivia, but not relevant in the modern era.

# X509 Certificates

*Traditional file extension: ".crt" or ".cert"*

- *Certificate* or *cert* for short
- An ASN.1 object with a public key and metadata
- Signed by
  - Trusted third party
  - Self-signed (which means "trust me; I wouldn't lie to you")
- Used for identification since the private key is only known by the cert
  owner
- Most frequently used with SSL/TLS to ensure you are connecting to the
  server you think you're connecting to.
- Defined in [RFC 5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280)

--
# X509 - Anatomy

- *Version*: "3" is the latest
- *Serial Number*: Of limited interest.  Use a SHA1 fingerprint for
  identification
- *Issuer*: Entity that vouches for this certificate
- *Validity*: How long is this certificate good?
- *Subject*: Who the certificate owner claims to be
- *Extensions*: Many and varied.  We'll get back to these
- *Certificate Signature*: An unforgeable signature from the Issuer to prove
  the certificate hasn't been tampered with
- *Subject Public Key Info*: The components of the public key

Note:
We'll talk about the purpose of the Validity when we get to certificate
revocation lists.

Note:
The validity period on this certificate is more than one would expect for a
plain vanilla certificate identifying a server.

# Certificate Authorities

- *CA* for short
- Trusted third-parties that put their seal of approval on a certificate
- The "seal of approval" is based on the CA's private key
- Commercial CAs will externally verify you before signing (and charge you
  some money)
- CAs sign certificates with other, special certificates
  ```none
  X509v3 extensions:
    X509v3 Basic Constraints:
      CA:TRUE
  ```

Note:
If you are getting a certificate for a domain name for example, the CA will
require you to respond to an email sent to the Registrant Email stored in
DNS.

--
# Trust
- Trust is in a chain
  - Sometimes there are two links: subject and issuer.
  - Many CAs have sub-CAs, so you could have: subject, sub-sub-CA, sub-CA,
    root CA
- Clients walk the chain until they find a CA they trust
- Trust has to begin somewhere, so root CA certs are self-signed

--
# Trust

- A CA is useless if no one trusts it, so the certificates for commercial CAs
  need to be disseminated somehow
- Systems (e.g. Fedora, Firefox, Chrome) contain a *truststore* with a
  list of commercial CA certificates
- When clients try to make a connection using certificates (e.g. SSL/TLS)
  and the Issuer of the server cert is unknown, the client aborts the connection
  ```none
  % curl https://koji.fedoraproject.org
  curl: (60) Peer's certificate issuer has been marked as not trusted by the user.
  More details here: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html

  curl performs SSL certificate verification by default, using a "bundle"
   of Certificate Authority (CA) public keys (CA certs). If the default
   bundle file isn't adequate, you can specify an alternate file
   using the --cacert option.
  If this HTTPS server uses a certificate signed by a CA represented in
   the bundle, the certificate verification probably failed due to a
   problem with the certificate (it might be expired, or the name might
   not match the domain name in the URL).
  If you'd like to turn off curl's verification of the certificate, use
   the -k (or --insecure) option.
  ```

--
# Certificate Authorities - Roll Your Own

- No reason you can't create your own CA.  Perfectly reasonable for large
  organizations (and much cheaper)
- The trick is to make sure everyone in your organization has and trusts the
  CA certificate
  ```none
  % curl --cacert ~/.fedora-server-ca.cert https://koji.fedoraproject.org
  <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
  <html><head>
  <title>302 Found</title>
  </head><body>
  <h1>Found</h1>
  <p>The document has moved <a href="https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji">here</a>.</p>
  </body></html>
  ```

Note:
The certificate for koji.fedoraproject.org that we looked at earlier is not
signed by a commercial CA and most systems won't have the CA the cert used
in their truststores.  If we connect and tell curl explicitly that we trust
the Fedora Project CA, everything works.

--
# Truststores - The Devil is in the Details

- A repository of trusted CAs
- There are a half dozen different ways used to add CAs
  - Path to the PEM for the CA cert (curl)
  - Various types of binary stores
    - PKCS12
    - JKS (Tomcat, other Java tools)
    - NSS DB (Firefox)
  - Place CA PEM in special directory (Docker)
  - Add to the system truststore (nuclear option)

--
# Truststores - Adding to the System Truststore

- System truststore managed with the `ca-certificates` package in Fedora
- ***Do not add CAs casually!***
- Adding to it is simple:
  ```none
  # curl https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/fedora-server-ca.cert -o
/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/cert
  # update-ca-trust extract
  ```
- You can also blacklist certificates by placing them in
  `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/blacklist`

Note:
A Fedora system has a CA bundle (based on the Mozilla database of CAs)
courtesy of the `ca-certificates` package.

--
# Keys

*Traditional file extension: ".key"*

- The signee's private key
- Guarded with utmost care
- RSA is most common currently for certificates
- 2048-bit is the minimum you should use and good for around 20 years
  worth of security
- 4096-bit isn't a bad choice for high value items (e.g. CA keys)

--
# Certificate Signing Requests

*Traditional file extension: ".csr"*

- *CSR* for short
- Means of communication between a signee and a CA
- Contains requester's public key, the identity the requester is asserting,
  additional extensions the requester wants
- Send it off to the CA
- CA requires you to prove you have the identity in the CSR
- CA sends you back a signed certificate
- The CSR file can generally be discarded at this point

Note:
A CSR can even be signed by multiple CAs.  This practice is called
"cross-signing".  You end up with two equally valid certificates because a
certificate can only have one Issuer.

--
# Certificate Revocation Lists

*Traditional file extension: ".crl"*

- *CRL* for short
- What happens when a signee loses or leaks their private key?
    - The certificate is no longer secure
    - People need to be informed of the breach
- CAs maintain a certificate revocation list
- CRLs are ASN.1 lists of revoked certificate serial numbers and digitally
  signed by the CAs
- Weakness is that clients have to check the CRL!
- Other revocation mechanism is *Online Certificate Status Protocol* (OCSP)
- Validity periods on certificates keep the CRL from growing without bound

Note:
Digitally signing CRLs allows CAs to serve them over HTTP.  Why?  If they
were served over HTTPS, clients would end up having to check the revocation
status of the CRL server resulting in a vicious cycle

--
# Certificate Extensions

- Various sorts of metadata added to certificates
- Sent in the CSR, *but the CA doesn't have to include them in the signed
  cert!*
  - Always double check the cert you get back if you asked for special
    extensions
- Two types: critical (must be parsed) and non-critical (may be ignored if
  not understood)
- If you are a wizard, you can even write your own

Note:
CAs not including extensions will be discussed with OpenSSL

--
# Certificate Extensions - SubjectAltName

- Very useful extension
- In SSL/TLS, the hostname you connect to *must* be the same as the CN in the
  subject of the certificate
  ```none
  Subject: C=US, ST=Washington, L=Seattle, O=Amazon.com, Inc., CN=www.amazon.com
  ```
- Why?  Otherwise a man in the middle (MITM) can get a cert signed for any
  domain and then use it to impersonate someone else
- **It's not enough that a certificate is signed; it must also actually identify
  the entity presenting it!**
- SubjectAltName extensions allow multiple identities per cert
  ```none
  X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
    DNS:www.amazon.com,
    DNS:www.amzn.com,
    DNS:amzn.com,
    DNS:uedata.amazon.com,
    DNS:amazon.com
  ```
- Don't worry with these unless you need to.  OpenSSL makes it tedious to add
  these extensions

--
# Certificate Extensions - BasicConstraints

- Identifies whether a certificate can be used as a CA or not
  ```none
  X509v3 Basic Constraints:
    CA:FALSE
  ```
- Can also set the length of the trust chain for a CA with "pathlen"
- `pathlen: 0` means this certificate cannot sign other CAs

--
# Certificate Extensions - Miscellaneous

- CRL Distribution Points: On CA certs to point to the CRL
- Authority Key Identifier: fingerprint of public key that signed the cert
- Subject Key Identifier: fingerprint of public key of cert (required for
  CA certs)
- Name Constraints: namespaces the certificates the CA can sign
- Key Usage/Extended Key Usage: place restrictions on the cert's key
  ```none
  X509v3 Key Usage: critical
    Digital Signature, Key Encipherment
  X509v3 Extended Key Usage:
    TLS Web Server Authentication, TLS Web Client Authentication
  ```
- These extensions are generally either taken care of for you by tooling or
  not commonly needed in development environments

--
# Keystores

- For important keys, you don't want to leave it laying around on the filesystem
    - Solution?  Encrypt the key with a symmetric cipher using a passphrase
- Some programs just won't read keys from the filesystem (e.g. Tomcat)
    - Encryption is optional if you just need a container for the key
- Types:
  - PKCS12
  - JKS
  - NSS DB
- Same formats as the truststores discussed earlier
- Generally painful

Note:
If you are really security conscious, you'll store the private key on a
hardware device and keep the device locked up.
