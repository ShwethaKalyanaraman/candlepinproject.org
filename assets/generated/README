The syntax highlighting styles are based on the Solarized color scheme
(http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) and the CSS is adapted from
https://gist.github.com/nicolashery/5765395.  I have altered the CSS and made
it into a LESS non-outputting mixin
(http://lesscss.org/features/#mixins-feature-not-outputting-the-mixin)

If you wish to use a different CSS, you can create one easily from the
built-in Pygments styles.

You can get a list of styles with

pygmentize -L styles

Once you have the style you like, you can generate a style sheet like so:

pygmentize -S <some_style> -f html > pygments.less

Note that the extension should be '.less'.  LESS is a superset of CSS so
you should have no problems.
