# Thumbslug

## Introduction
Thumbslug is an open source proxy for Candlepin written using [JBoss Netty](http://www.jboss.org/netty).

## Why Thumbslug?
To continue the bowling theme started with Candlepin we chose another uncommon bowling term.
A [Thumbslug](http://www.bowling2u.com/trivia/glossary/glossary.asp?OpMode=Term&TermID=697) is "A plastic cylinder that is inserted into a hole that is drilled where your normal thumb hole would be; this plastic cylinder is then drilled out for your thumb."
