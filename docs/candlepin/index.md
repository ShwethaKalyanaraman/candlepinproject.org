# Candlepin
The Candlepin project is an open source software engine which has been designed
to manage subscriptions for software from both vendors' and customers' perspectives. It allows vendors to create a database of software they offer and then manage the database (change policies, revoke rights for the software for specific customers). It enables customers to consume their rights for the software and also enables them to transparently manage the software portfolio they acquired from the vendor.
