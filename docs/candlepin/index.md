# Candlepin
The Candlepin project is an open source software engine which has been designed
to solve this problem. It provides an API for client code to ask "What
subscriptions can I have" and then to actually assign a subscription to that
client. That assignment, or entitlement, therefore allows the consumer to make
use of the software or a feature of the software.
