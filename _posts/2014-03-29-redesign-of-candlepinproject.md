title: CandlepinProject.org gets a facelift
---
The Candlepin team is proud to present a significantly redesigned version
of CandlepinProject.org.  The new site is hosted on
[OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) and rendered using 
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).  We're using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
and [Less](http://lesscss.org) to provide the layout, styling, and JavaScript
components.

The [source of the site](https://github.com/candlepin/candlepinproject.org)
is hosted on GitHub so if you see a change you'd like us to make on the site
feel free to file a pull request or submit an issue!
